    <!---1.How does the elements appear.Does the width have any effect? why?-->
    <!---Answer: Width of elements does not change as span tag is inline and hence the words written in span tag will always take only space that is required by them .Hence width property specified in CSS cant change that words size. -->
    <!---2.next set display to inline.dOes it causes any change? Why?-->
    <!---Answer: No display inline doesnt cause any chnage as span tag is by default of type inline-->
    <!---3.next set display to block.What change does it cause?-->
    <!---Answer: The alignment of the words changes from side by side to one below other-->
    <!--HTML
        CSS
        Java Script-->
    <!---4.Next set display to inline block.What changes does it cause?-->
    <!---Answer: It is result of both inline and block effect. If you have set width : 40% then two words with e views on first row with 40% width and one word in second row. Incase now width is specified for words in span then all three words will appear side by side each other as they look in inline-->
    <!---In conclusion : In inline display elements apear side by side each other as they take only space that is required by them.-->
    <!-------------------In block display all elements get a blcok space and hence each element appear one below other-->
    <!-------------------In inlineblock the elements use characteristics of both inline and block while displaying .It Allows setting a width and height on the element.-->
