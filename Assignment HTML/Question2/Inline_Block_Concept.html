                <summary>1.How does the elements appear.Does the width have any effect? why?</summary>
                Answer: Width of elements does not change as span tag is inline and hence the words written in span tag will always take only space that is required by them.<br>Hence width property specified in CSS cant change that words size.

                Answer:It is result of both inline and block effect.If you have set width : 40% then two words will views on first row with 40% width and one word in second row.<br>Incase no width is specified for words in span then all three words will appear side by side each other as they look in inline
